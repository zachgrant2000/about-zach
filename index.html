        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Education: BS Business</li>
            <li>Work Experience: Commodities Risk Management</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>traded wheat in the Pacific Northwest (Washington, OR, MT) and sold to Asian markets</li>
                    <li> managed interconnected logistics of vessels (sales), shuttle trains (purchases), single rail cars (purchases), and barges (purchases) through a state-of-the-art export facility</li>
                    <li>executed hedges and traded a small futures book on the Chicago Board of Exchange</li>
                    <li>built Excel tools to manage the many constantly changing variables we dealt with:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Logistics: built massive spreadsheet to manage above logistics.</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Upsides: The project enabled us to better project inventory and when possible to optimize timing of departures (vessels) and arrivals (trains, cars, barges) of shipments for multiple classes, subclasses, and byproducts of commodity: Corn, Soybeans,  3 classes of wheat (each with different protein levels), and various byproducts.</li>
                                        <li>Downsides: among others, it took way too long to sync between all users on a shared network, probably due to my limited coding skills as well as our slow server.</li>
                                    </ul>
                            <li>Market Side: price fluctuations on both global (futures) and local (basis) levels</li>
                            <li>Research: Monitoring of both the official USDA and also our own internal Supply and Demand Reports</li>
                            <li>Financial: Daily monitoring of PnL fluctuations based on changes in our position (purchases vs. sales) and the corresponding fluctuations in price</li>
                            <li>Trading: Semi-automated daily publication of bids to our suppliers and offers to our buyers</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>This is the facility:</li>

                    <li>At full capacity a 110 car train could be unloaded in 4 hours without the train stopping, and the cargo of 4 of those trains could be loaded on a Panamax vessel in less than a day (both industry bests).</li>
